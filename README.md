# IDS706 Week 5: CRUD Operations with SQL

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates how to connect to a SQL database, perform CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete) operations, and write SQL queries within a Python script. The project includes:
1. Database connection to an SQLite database.
2. Basic CRUD operations.
3. Two different SQL queries.
4. Implementation of a CI/CD pipeline to automate testing.
5. A simple README file.

## Requirements

### 1. **Database Connection**
The Python script connects to an SQLite database using the `sqlite3` module. The database is dynamically created if it doesn't already exist. All database operations are conducted within this connection.

### 2. **CRUD Operations**
We demonstrate the following CRUD operations:
- **Create:** Insert new records into a table.
- **Read:** Query and retrieve records from the table.
- **Update:** Modify existing records within the table.
- **Delete:** Remove records from the table.
